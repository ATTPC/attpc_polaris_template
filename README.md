# attpc_polaris_template

This is a template codespace for using the [attpc_spyral](https://github.com/ATTPC/Spyral) analysis framework on Polaris, the supercomputer at the ALCF at ANL. It serves as a location from which one can supply the appropriate configuration controls and contains a script which can create a PBS job script and submit the script to PBS to run the analysis through an installed Docker (actually apptainer) image which contains attpc_spyral.

This template can be used in practice, or it can be used simply as a guide for how to setup a codespace to use attpc_spyral at Polaris.
